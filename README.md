#Defect Detection Algorithm
There is a growing need of defect detection algorithms/models, specifically in the manufacturing industry for example automobiles, to accurately detect the defects in the manufactured parts. This algorithm compares point clouds of the manufactured part (with possible defects) with the ideal point clouds (with no defect) of the same part. The algorithmhas been tested on several point clouds the results of which are shown below
